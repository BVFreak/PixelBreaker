# PixelBreaker
Pixel Breaker is a stealth game where you play as a hacker who can only see the level when he is standing still. You and your mentor are data thieves who break into high-security buildings and steal valuable information from corporations. But, your latest heist goes bad when you are betrayed by a fellow data thief, attempting to steal your data.
